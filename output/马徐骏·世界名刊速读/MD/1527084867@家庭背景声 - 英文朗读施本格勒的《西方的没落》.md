> 施本格勒写作这本书时正值一战。窗外炮火连天，他在慕尼黑的一个小屋里写出了这部煌煌巨著。这不是一本普通意义上的历史作品。施本格勒把这套书骄傲地称为德国哲学。他要用这本书，预断历史。他认为，世间一切文明都有生命，都有生老病死，所以断言西方终将没落。他说：西方的没落“将占据未来一千年中的前几个世纪，但其没落的征兆早已经预示出来，且今日就在我们周围可以感觉到”。

CHAPTER XII

THE STATE PHILOSOPHY OF POLITICS

To POLITICS as an idea we have given more thought than has been good for us, since, correspondingly, we have understood all the less about the observation of politics as a reality. The great statesmen are accustomed to act immediately and on the basis of a sure flair for facts. This is so self-evident, to them, that it simply never enters their heads to reflect upon the basic general principles of their action - supposing indeed that such exist. In all ages they have known what they had to do, and any theory of this knowledge has been foreign to both their capacities and their tastes. But the professional thinkers who have turned their attention to the faits accomplis of men have been so remote, inwardly, from these actions that they have just spun for themselves a web of abstractions - for preference, abstraction-myths like justice, virtue, freedom and then applied them as criteria to past and, especially, future historical happening. Thus in the end they have forgotten that concepts are only concepts, and brought themselves to the conclusion that there is a political science whereby we can form the course of the world according to an ideal recipe. As nothing of the kind has ever or anywhere happened, political doing has come to be considered as so trivial in comparison with abstract thinking that they debate in their books whether there is a "genius of action" at all.

Here, on the contrary, the attempt will be made to  give, instead of an ideological system, a physiognomy of politics as it has actually been practised in the course of general history, and not as it might or ought to have been practised. The problem was, and is, to penetrate to the final meaning of great events, to “see" them, to feel and to transcribe the symbolically important in them. The projects of world-improvers and the actuality of History have nothing to do with, one another.

The being-streams of humanity are called History when we regard them as movement, and family, estate, people, nation, when we regard them as the object moved. Politics is the way in which this fluent Being maintains itself, grows,  triumphs over other life-streams. All living is politics, in every trait of

instinct, in the inmost marrow.  That which we nowadays like to call life-energy

(vitality), the" it" in us that at all costs strives forward and upward, the blind cosmic drive to validity and power that at the same time remains, plantwise and racewise, bound up with the earth, the "home"-land; . the directedness, the need to actualize - it is this that appears in every higher mankind, as its political life, seeking naturally and inevitably the great decisions that determine whether it shall be, or shall suffer, a Destiny. For it grows or it dies out; there is no third possibility.
