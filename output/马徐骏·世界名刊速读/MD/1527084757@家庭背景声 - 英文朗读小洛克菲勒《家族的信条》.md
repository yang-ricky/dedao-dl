 **|**  **Our Family Creed**

They are the principles on which my wife and I have tried to bring up our family. They are the principles in which my father believed and by which he governed his life. They are the principles, many of them, which I learned at my mother's knee.

They point the way to usefulness and happiness in life, to courage and peace in death.

If they mean to you what they mean to me, they may perhaps be helpful also to our sons for their guidance and inspiration.

Let me state them:

* 1. I believe in the supreme worth of the individual and in his right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

* 2. I believe that every right implies a responsibility; every opportunity, an obligation; every possession, a duty.

* 3. I believe that the law was made for man and not man for the law; that government is the servant of the people and not their master.

* 4. I believe in the dignity of labor, whether with head or hand; that the world owes no man a living but that it owes every man an opportunity to make a living.

* 5. I believe that thrift is essential to well-ordered living and that economy is a prime requisite of a sound financial structure, whether in government business or personal affairs.

* 6. I believe that truth and justice are fundamental to an enduring social order.

* 7. I believe in the sacredness of a promise; that a man's word should be as good as his bond, that character—not wealth or power or position—is of supreme worth.

* 8. I believe that the rendering of useful service is the common duty of mankind and that only in the purifying fire of sacrifice is the dross of selfishness consumed and the greatness of the human soul set free.

* 9. I believe in an all-wise and all-loving God, named by whatever name, and that the inpiduals' highest fulfillment, greatest happiness and widest usefulness are to be found in living in harmony with His will.

* 10. I believe that love is the greatest thing in the world; that it alone can overcome hate; that right can and will triumph over might.

These are the principles, however formulated, for which all good men and women throughout the world, irrespective of race or creed, education, social position or occupation, are standing, and for which many of them are suffering and dying.

These are the principles upon which alone a new world recognizing the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God can be established.

洛克菲勒家族是美国最富有的家族，约翰·D·洛克菲勒(1839—1937年)是这个家族的创始人，他也是人类有史以来第一位亿万富翁。这位美国石油大王把其财富的一半用于慈善事业，他开创的石油王朝在美国的垄断地位达85年之久。第二代小洛克菲勒把主要精力用在维持老洛克菲勒留下的慈善事业上，而其第三代——成为银行家的约翰·戴维·洛克菲勒是这个家族的金融管家，也是五兄弟中最小的一个，其他兄弟还包括曾任纽约州州长和美国副总统的纳尔逊·洛克菲勒。
