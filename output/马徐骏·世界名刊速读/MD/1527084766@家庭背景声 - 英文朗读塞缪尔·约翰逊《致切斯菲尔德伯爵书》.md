# 家庭背景声 | 英文朗读塞缪尔·约翰逊《致切斯菲尔德伯爵书》

> 马徐骏
> 
> 塞缪尔·约翰逊是英国著名的学者、语言学家和文学家，英国古典主义代表人物之一，在散文写作方面堪称一代大家。我们之前就推送过他的散文名篇《谈话的艺术》。
> 
> 这封信的写作背景是，约翰逊在1747年开始酝酿编撰《英语词典》 ，因为自己境况十分窘迫，于是把编撰计划呈送给当时英国最显赫的达官贵人切斯菲尔德伯爵，希望得到他的支持与赞助。可是切斯菲尔德不置可否，让他吃了个闭门羹。约翰逊不得已之下，自力更生，用了整整7年终于编成词典。这时候，切斯菲尔德闻讯突然抢先在当时的一家流行的报纸《世界报》上连续发表了两篇推祟约翰逊词典的文章，暗示他是约翰逊词典的幕后赞助人。约翰逊旧怨难消，于是给切斯菲尔德写了这封信，断然否认切斯菲尔德或其他任何人是他的赞助人。
> 
> 这封信虽然语气谦卑，然而内藏讥嘲，把切斯菲尔德巧妙地比作附庸风雅实际上并没有文化修养的、心肠冷酷的“草野之夫”。在欧洲文学史上，这封信历来被看作作家的“独立宣言”。从此以后，欧洲文人被迫“摧眉折腰事权贵”的历史，开始了一个崭新的转折。

 **|**  **Letter to Chesterfield**

My Lord:

I have been lately informed by the proprietor of the World that two Papers in which my Dictionary is recommended to the Public were written by your Lordship. To be so distinguished is an honour which, being very little accustomed to favours from the Great, I know not well how to receive, or in what terms to acknowledge.

When upon some slight encouragement I first visited your Lordship I was overpowered like the rest of Mankind by the enchantment of your address, and could not forbear to wish that I might boast myself Le Vainqueur du Vainqueur de la Terre, that I might obtain that regard for which I saw the world contending, but I found my attendance so little incouraged, that neither pride nor modesty would suffer me to continue it. When I had once addressed your Lordship in public, I had exhausted all the Art of pleasing which a retired and uncourtly Scholar can possess. I had done all that I could, and no Man is well pleased to have his all neglected, be it ever so little.

Seven years, My lord have now past since I waited in your outward Rooms or was repulsed from your Door, during which time I have been pushing on my work through difficulties of which it is useless to complain, and have brought it at last to the verge of Publication without one Act of assistance, one word of encouragement, or one smile of favour. Such treatment I did not expect, for I never had a Patron before.

The Shepherd in Virgil grew at last acquainted with Love, and found him a Native of the Rocks. Is not a Patron, My Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a Man struggling for Life in the water and when he has reached ground encumbers him with help. The notice which you have been pleased to take of my Labours, had it been early, had been kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent and cannot enjoy it, till I am solitary and cannot impart it, till I am known, and do not want it.

I hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess obligation where no benefit has been received, or to be unwilling that the Public should consider me as owing that to a Patron, which Providence has enabled me to do for myself.

Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favourer of Learning I shall not be disappointed though I should conclude it, if less be possible, with less, for I have been long wakened from that Dream of hope, in which I once boasted myself with so much exultation, My lord,

Your Lordship's Most humble, most obedient servant，

S.J.
