> 《呼啸山庄》被人们认为是英国文学史上一部“最奇特的小说”，也是世界文学史上的经典代表作之一。它通过一个看似脱离现实的爱情悲剧故事，向人们描述了真实的19世纪英国社会的扭曲并反射出人性的善与恶，一反同一时期的低沉阴郁的文学作品，艾米莉 · 勃朗特用鲜明的爱和恨表现出了当时人们的真实生活。
> 
> 艾米莉 · 勃朗特本人是一个内向又缄默的人，她需要一个“发泄口”来抒发自己心中的困惑和不安，于是她创作了《呼啸山庄》这部小说，并借用小说这种文学体裁表达出她内心深处几近撕裂的痛苦和追求自我的情愫。

 **| Wuthering Heights  **

 **Chapter 9  The Disappearance of Heathcliff**

by Emily Bronte

It was a very dark evening for summer: the clouds appeared inclined to thunder, and I said we had better all sit down; the approaching rain would be certain to bring him home without further trouble. However, Catherine would not be persuaded into tranquillity. She kept wandering to and fro, from the gate to the door, in a state of agitation which permitted no repose; and at length took up a permanent situation on one side of the wall, near the road: where, heedless of my expostulatens and the growling thunder, and the great drops that began to plash around her, she remained, calling at intervals, and then listening, and then crying outright. She beat Hareton, or any child, at a good passionate fit of crying.

About midnight, while we still sat up, the storm came rattling over the Heights in full fury. There was a violent wind, as well as thunder, and either one or the other split a tree off at the corner of the building: a huge bough fell across the roof, and knocked down a portion of the east chimney-stack, sending a clatter of stones and soot into the kitchen fire. We thought a bolt had fallen in the middle of us; and Joseph swung on to his knees, beseeching the Lord to remember the patriarchs Noah and Lot, and, as in former times, spare the righteous, though he smote the ungodly. I felt some sentiment that it must be a judgment on us also. The Jonah, in my mind, was Mr Earnshaw; and I shook the handle of his den that I might ascertain if he were yet living. He replied audibly enough, in a fashion which made my companion vociferate, more clamorously than before, that a wide distinction might be drawn between saints like himself and sinners like his master. But the uproar passed away in twenty minutes, leaving us all unharmed; excepting Cathy, who got thoroughly drenched for her obstinacy in refusing to take shelter, and standing bonnetless and shawl-less to catch as much water as she could with her hair and clothes. She came in and lay down on the settle, all soaked as she was, turning her face to the back, and putting her hands before it.
