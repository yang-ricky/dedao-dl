# 家庭背景声 | 英文朗读狄兰·托马斯《不要温和地走进那个良夜》

> 托马斯·狄兰是一个浪漫主义者，一个有着自我毁灭激情的诗人。因为觉得自己活不长，他自称要创造一个“紧迫的狄兰”。他的诗歌探索生命、爱与死亡，充斥着强烈的激情和冲突，也洋溢着神秘原始的力量。可惜的是，像大多数爱尔兰男人一样，狄兰喜欢酗酒。在39岁这年，他连干了十八杯纯威士忌，因此丧命。在《星际穿越》这部电影中，这首诗歌被反复吟唱，提升了整部电影的意蕴与想象空间。

 **Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night**

by Dylan Thomas

Do not go gentle into that good night,

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,

Because their words had forked no lightning they

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright

Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,

And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight

Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,

Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
