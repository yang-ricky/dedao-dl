# 家庭背景声 | 英文朗读赫胥黎《月之冥想》

> 在东方，月亮是永恒而浪漫的，“江畔何人初见月？江月何年初照人？”而在西方文学中，月亮却蕴藏着黑暗的力量，忧郁、神秘、变化无常。法国诗人波德莱尔笔下的月亮是一个忧愁的女人，而莎翁写：“不要指着月亮发誓，它变换无常。”

> 英格兰著名作家赫胥黎创作了大量的小说和散文，他笔下的月亮，继承了西方文学传统却又增添了一丝神秘主义色彩。这块“神秘的石头”不断变化，“它不仅直接影响人们，还可以迂回曲折地通过血液影响着人们的灵魂。”“我们的精神世界也因为它神秘地随之时起时落。时常有无缘无故的兴奋、痛苦、欢笑和悔恨。”

 **|**  **Meditation on the moon**

The moon is a stone; but it is a highly numinous stone. Or, to be more precise, it is a stone about which and because of which men and women have numinous feelings. Thus, there is a soft moonlight that can give us the peace that passes understanding. There is a moonlight that inspires a kind of awe. There is a cold and austere moonlight that tells the soul of its loneliness and desperate isolation, its insignificance or its uncleanness. There is an amorous moonlight prompting to love - to love not only for an individual but sometimes even for the whole universe. 

But the moon shines on the body as well as, through the windows of the eyes, within the mind. It affects the soul directly; but it can affect it also by obscure and circuitous ways - through the blood. Half the human race lives in manifest obedience to the lunar rhythm; and there is evidence to show that the physiological and therefore the spiritual life, not only of women, but of men too, mysteriously ebbs and flows with the changes of the moon. There are unreasoned joys, inexplicable miseries, laughers and remorses without a cause. Their sudden and fantastic alternations constitute the ordinary weather of our minds. 

These moods, of which the more gravely numinous may be hypostasized as gods, the lighter, if we will, as hobgoblins and fairies, are the children of the blood and humours. But the blood and humours obey, among many other masters, the changing moon. Touching the soul directly through the eyes and, indirectly, along the dark channels of the blood, the moon is doubly a pinity. Even dogs and wolves, to judge at least by their nocturnal howlings, seem to feel in some dim bestial fashion a kind of numinous emotion about the full moon. Artemis, the goddess of wild things, is identified in the later mythology with Selene.

Even if we think of the moon as only a stone, we shall find its very stoniness potentially a numen. A stone gone cold. An airless, waterless stone and the prophetic image of our own earth, when some few million years from now, the senescent sun shall have lost its present fostering power.... And so on. This passage could easily be prolonged-a Study in Purple. But I forbear. Let every reader lay on as much of the royal rhetorical color as he finds to his taste. Anyhow, purple or no purple, there the stone is-stony. You cannot think about it for long without finding yourself invaded by one or other of several essentially numinous sentiments. These sentiments belong to one or other of two contrasted and complementary groups. The name of the first family is Sentiments of Human Insignificance, of the second, Sentiments of Human Greatness. Meditating on that derelict stone afloat there in the abyss, you may feel most numinously a worm, abject and futile in the face of wholly incomprehensible immensities. 'The silence of those infinite spaces frightens me.’

You may feel as Pascal felt. Or, alternatively, you may feel as M. Paul Valery has said that he feels. 'The silence of those infinite spaces does not frighten me.' For the spectacle of that stony astronomical moon need not necessarily make you feel like a worm. It may, on the contrary, cause you to rejoice exultantly in your manhood. There floats the stone, the nearest and most familiar symbol of all the astronomical horrors; but the astronomers who discovered those horrors of space and time were men. The universe throws down a challenge to the human spirit; in spite of his insignificance and abjection, man has taken it up. The stone glares down at us out of the black boundlessness, a memento mori. But the fact that we know it for a memento mori justifies us in feeling a certain human pride. We have a right to our moods of sober exultation.
