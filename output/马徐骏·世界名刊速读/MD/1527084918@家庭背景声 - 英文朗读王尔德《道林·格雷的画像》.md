> 
> 奥斯卡·王尔德是英国唯美主义艺术运动的倡导者，他学识渊博、装束怪异、谈吐幽默，生活放荡不羁。《道林·格雷的画像》发表于1891 年，小说一发表即遭到批评界暴风骤雨般非议，更直接导致了王尔德以“同性恋”的罪名入狱，可以说，他唯一的这部长篇小说表达了他“唯美主义”的人生哲学，也是他人生的映照。
> 
> 这部作品中的道林·格雷是一位伦敦的贵族少年，相貌俊美，心地善良。当他见到画家霍尔沃德为他画的像后发现了自己惊人的美，于是在朋友亨利勋爵的蛊惑下，向画像许下心愿：美少年青春永葆，所有岁月的沧桑和少年的罪恶都由画像承担。最终走向了一条出卖灵魂来换取美貌不朽的堕落之路。
> 
> 今天的这一段文字便是文章开篇亨利勋爵蛊惑道林·格雷的一段话。它唯美酣畅，也是理解整部作品的题眼。

 **| The Picture of Dorian Gray**

Oscar Wilde

Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing worth having.

Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly. 

Now, wherever you go, you charm the world. Will it always be so? You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don't frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation. It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon. 

It cannot be questioned. It has its pine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile? Ah! when you have lost it you won't smile.People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is. To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible.

Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully. When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats. Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses. You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly.

 Ah! realize your youth while you have it. Don't squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age. Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations. Be afraid of nothing.

A new Hedonism that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do. The world belongs to you for a season. 

The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be. There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted. For there is such a little time that your youth will last--such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again. The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars.

But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish. Our limbs fail, our senses rot. We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!"
