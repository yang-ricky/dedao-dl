# 博弈论特别放送：改变规则，才能改变局面（视频）

> 万维钢最近我们在讲《博弈论》专题，今天就为你放送我为“得到”特意制作的一个视频短片：7分钟看懂博弈论，并且附上中英文的文稿。希望对你学习《博弈论》有所帮助。

博弈论这个词你已经很熟悉了，我来给你讲一个“得到版”的博弈论。是专门讲给你这样的聪明人的。

You are no stranger to the term Game Theory. However today I’ll elaborate on an iGet version of this theory specifically tailored for smart people like you.

博弈论研究的就是一群聪明人，在一定的规则之下，如何选取最有利于自己的策略。传统上一说到博弈都是研究怎么选择更高明的策略，而我想告诉你的是，如果各方都足够理性，那么最终决定局面的不是策略，而是规则。

Game theory is about how a group of smart people adopt strategies that are most favorable to themselves under certain rules. Traditionally, we search for a better strategy when the word GAME is involved, but what I’m about to tell you is that if all parties are rational enough, it will be the rules that decides who wins a game, not strategies.

咱们中国一说智慧总爱拿“田忌赛马”举例子。本来赛马比赛的约定是上马对上马中马对中马下马对下马，田忌在一场比赛中用下马对齐威王的上马，上马对中马，中马对下马，结果二比一取胜。这个例子，恰恰不是博弈论。

Our fellow Chinese love to bring up the story of Tian Ji’s Horse Race as a case in point. Once Tian Ji, the general, was invited to a horse-racing event hosted by the king. The default rule is to put horses in the same grade for each race, when Tian used his inferior horse to race with the king's best horse, his average against the king's inferior, and his best against the king's average. By doing so, Tian won the king two out of the three races. That case, however, is not an example of game theory.

你想想啊。如果田忌赛马这招好使，为什么历史上再就没发生第二次呢？因为田忌违反了规则，等于是欺骗了齐威王。被你骗一次是你不对，被你骗两次那可就是我不对了。

Think about it. If Tian’s trick was truly a good move, why didn’t it happen in history for a second time? It’s because Tian broke the rules, which is tantamount to cheating. If you cheat once, you are the one to blame. But if I let you cheat twice, then I’m the one to blame.

事实上现在的团体比赛根本不可能让一方先确定出场名单，然后给另一方田忌赛马的机会。像汤姆斯杯羽毛球赛更是必须按照世界排名分顺序出场。

In fact, in modern team competitions, both sides are requested to submit their order of play at the same time, so neither side has the chance to put Tian Ji’s trick into practice. As in the Thomas Cup, players must compete in order of their world ranking.

博弈论专门研究各方都不是蠢人的游戏。现在“行为经济学”、“非理性”这些概念非常流行，在我看来它们有点被高估了。生活中绝大多数人面对绝大多数局面的决策其实是非常理性的。

Game theory focuses on games in which no players are fool. Nowadays the notion of Behavioral Economics and “irrational” are popular, but from my perspective, they are overrated. In most cases in life, people are making rather “rational” decisions.

博弈论要求你假设，你能想到的，别人也能想到，那你怎么办。你的任何行动都得考虑对手的反应。这里面没有阴谋，全是阳谋。但是阳谋其实比阴谋更难算，从冯·诺依曼创始博弈论开始这就是一个烧脑的数学理论，博弈论里的英雄是约翰·纳什这样的天才。

Game theory requires you to assume that if you can think of it, others can think of it too. Then what should you do? Before making any move, you ought to take into consideration all possible countermeasures from your opponent. No stabbing in the back. Everything is put on the table, making it even harder to plot and scheme. Game theory is full of mathematical puzzles forcing people to rack their brains ever since Von Neumann created it. The heroes in game theory are geniuses like John Nash.

 *普通人研究怎么让自己的行为比别人聪明一点 —— 聪明人研究规则。*

 *Ordinary people are obsessed with how to outsmart others in their actions, while smart people dive deep into the rules.*

比如说就几年前，中国的学生几乎数学成绩稍微好一点的人都在学“奥数”。本来数学奥林匹克是个很美好的事儿，是那些真心爱好数学的学生竞技的舞台，怎么能人人都学奥数呢？

For instance, just a few years ago, nearly all the Chinese students whose math grades were better than average studied for the Math Olympiad. The Math Olympiad, per se, was supposed to be a beautiful thing, a wonderful stage for the true math lovers among students, then why had it become a must for almost everyone?

根本原因在于当时中国有个奥数成绩能给高考加分的规则。如果有条件的都在学，那你怎么办呢？所有人都在理性行事，结果却是所有人的境遇都更差了。这个局面不是心理学问题也不是行为经济学问题 —— 这其实是个数学问题。

The answer is simple and harsh: all because of a policy––good results in the Math Olympiad can add bonus points to the student’s scores on Gaokao, the National College Entrance Examination. So if everyone is scrambled to take extra courses for the Math Olympiad, what do you do? In this case, everyone acts rationally, but everyone ends up in a worse situation. It is not a psychological issue, nor a behavioral economics issue––it is actually a mathematical issue.

 *有的人研究怎么违反规则，有的人研究怎么适应规则 —— 高手研究怎么改变规则。*

 *Some people find ways to violate the rules; some find ways to better follow the rules. The master, however, find ways to change the rules.*

比如说烟草广告。历史上曾经有一个时期，美国的烟草公司可以随便发展。到1960年代的时候，烟草市场就已经饱和了。全国总共就有这么多人吸烟，市场总共就这么大，几家大烟草公司无非就是瓜分一个有限的市场，你要多拿一点份额，我就得少拿一点。

Let’s take cigarette advertising for example. There was a time in history when tobacco companies in the United States could develop as they wish. In the 1960s, the market became saturated. The number of the smokers was holding steady, so was the market. Those tobacco giants were doing nothing more than carving up a very limited market. You get more, I get less, just like that.

这个局面叫做“零和博弈”。零和博弈的竞争是最激烈的。各个烟草公司就不得不花越来越多的钱做广告，大家的总投入越来越大，可是总的市场还是只有这么大，这就是一个困局。

This is called a zero-sum game. It has the fiercest competition. Tobacco companies had to pump more and more dollars into advertising. However, all those efforts proved futile in upsizing the total market. They were in a true predicament.

与此同时呢，因为当时人们越来越意识到吸烟的危害，政府就开始推动立法，想限制烟草业的发展。1967年，美国联邦通信委员会（FCC）发布一条规定，说电视台每播出香烟广告，就必须同时播出一条宣传“吸烟有害健康”的公益广告。

Meanwhile, people were increasingly aware of the hazards of smoking. The government thus began to push for legislation to restrict the expansion of tobacco industry. In 1967, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a regulation, that every cigarette ad broadcasted should come with a public-service announcement saying “smoking is dangerous to your health”.

这一来烟草业的局面就更可悲了：你不得不花钱给自己做广告，可是花钱的结果却是公众越来越了解吸烟有害健康，这等于是作死啊。

It’s even more tragic for the tobacco companies: you have to spend millions on cigarette advertising, but only to let the public realize that smoking is hazardous? It was suicide, wasn’t it?

等到1970年，美国国会通过一条法律，干脆就禁止了烟草公司做电视广告。但公众不知道、甚至连很多国会议员都不知道的是，这条立法其实是烟草公司自己运做出来的 —— 他们改变了规则。

Then in 1970, the US Congress passed a law, banning all cigarette ads on TV. But what the public––even many members of the Congress––did not know, is that tobacco companies themselves lobbied hard for the law. They changed the rules.

为什么烟草公司自己想要禁止自己呢？吸烟是一种刚需。大家都不做广告了，市场还是这么大，但是每个公司都能省下一大笔广告费，还不用再宣传“吸烟有害健康”了。

Why did tobacco companies bind their own hands and feet? Because smoking will always be a need. The total market will not shrink without advertising, but each company can save a fortune and they don’t have to promote “smoking is dangerous to your health” any more.

结果是一年之内，烟草公司的利润就提高了30%。

The outcome? The profits of tobacco companies saw a 30% surge within one year.

 *改变规则，你就改变了局面。*

 *By changing the rules, you change the situation.*

通过一个强制的规则停止恶性竞争，所有人的境遇都会更好。这就好比说现在国家改变规则，奥数成绩不能加分了，所有人的负担都能减轻，真正爱好数学的学生也得到一个更纯净的环境。

You can stop malign competition with a mandatory rule, and everyone ends up in a better

environment. Like…if the Chinese government changes the rule––no extra points added even with a good result in the Math Olympiad––the burden will be eased on all shoulders, and the students who do love math will have a simpler motivation.

博弈论有个特别流行的概念叫“囚徒困境”。说两个一起偷东西的犯罪嫌疑人被警察抓住分别关押审讯，双方都知道，如果双方不招供，俩人的结果都会更好 —— 但是因为规则，双方只能都选择招供。我们经常用“囚徒困境”形容每个人都按照对自己最优的策略行事，结果却是双输的局面。

A prevailing concept in game theory is called the Prisoner’s dilemma. It says that two members of a criminal gang are arrested and imprisoned separately in a solitary confinement, knowing that they would get the best reward if they both keep silent. But because of the rigid rules, they have no options but to betray and testify against each other. We often use the Prisoner’s dilemma to describe a situation when each person rationally adopts the strategy to the most of their own benefit, but oddly, both lose at the end.

其实从数学上讲，真正的囚徒困境要求双方不能搞联合和串通，而且必须同时行动。真实世界的各种困局没有那么严格的限制，所以是有可能打破的。

Mathematically, a true Prisoner’s dilemma requires no alliance or collusion of those two and they have to act simultaneously. But dilemmas in the real world are open to all conditions. They could be cracked.

拍卖会、竞价排名、给医生送红包、让孩子上各种课外班，这些都是博弈论的困境。参与者明知对自己不好、还不得不拼命参与。而工资封顶、监管法规、停火协议，就是解决困境的方法。很多时候是自由带来困境，限制带来活力。

Auctions, bid rankings, bribing doctors with red envelopes (with money inside), sending kids to cram schools…these are all dilemmas of game theory. Participants strive and struggle to get there, knowing that it is not beneficial to them at all. The solutions are also simple: a salary cap, a certain regulation, a ceasefire agreement…they all work. Most of the time, liberty comes with dilemmas, however restriction brings vigor.

学习了博弈论，你就多了一个观察世界的眼光，你会发现生活中有很多理性选择之下的困境。

By studying game theory, you obtain a new perspective to see the world. You will spot plenty of dilemmas led by rational decisions.

 *而你知道，造成这些困境的常常不是参与的人，而是规则。*

 *And you know that these dilemmas are not caused by the people in it, but by the rules.*

博弈论，是一个复杂的学问，当然不是我们今天讲的这么简单。我会在得到的课程《精英日课》里，继续跟你探讨。

Game theory is complicated. Of course it is not as simple as how I put it today. I will continue the discussion in another episode of Class for Elites in iGet (the app).
